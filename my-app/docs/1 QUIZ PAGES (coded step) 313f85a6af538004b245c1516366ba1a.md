**Before we build your plan — read this.**

If you've tried keto, calorie counting, or intermittent fasting and felt like you failed.

You didn't fail. The plan failed you.

Those systems were built on old science. Fixed rules. Generic templates.

They were never designed for how a man’s body actually works.

That changes right now.

Answer honestly. We'll do the rest.

1. **How familiar are you with Mediterranean diet & Blue Zones phenomena?**

### Their Secret To A Lean Body And Long Life. Now Finally Yours.

People in the world's longest-living regions  called **Blue Zones** — outlive everyone else.

They're also in better shape. Leaner. More energetic. And by every measure, among the happiest people on earth.

They don't count calories. They don't cut carbs. They eat real food, healthy fats, good ingredients.

It works because it was always personal.

Until now, nobody could replicate that for you. Specialist teams couldn't. Generic plans couldn't.

Now, an AI trained on millions of cases can.

It reads decades of research. It builds around your exact profile, in minutes.

**For the first time, the world's most proven longevity diet is being built around you, not everyone.**

### INFO BLOCK

☝️ **Your metabolism isn't broken. It's been given the wrong plan.**

Your body changes. Most plans don't.

A nutritionist sees you once a week. One hour. Limited data.

That's not personalization. That's guesswork on a schedule.

**Our AI-powered system runs 24/7.**

Trained on hundreds of years of research. Millions of real cases.

It adjusts when you adjust.

It never stops working on you.

</aside>

1. **When were you last at your best weight?**
- Less than 1 year ago
- 1–3 years ago
- More than 3 years ago
- I have never been at my best weight

1. **Have you tried any of these diets in the last 3 years?**

Select all that apply:

- Keto
- Intermittent fasting
- Low-carb
- Vegetarian
- Vegan
- Gluten free
- Other
- None of these

**Those diets weren't wrong because you did them wrong.**

They were wrong because they never changed.

Keto. Calorie counting. Low fat. High grain.

You followed the rules. Your body adapted. The plan didn't.

That's why it stopped working.

A diet that can't evolve with you isn't a diet. It's a timer.

**The science is clear now. Static plans fail. Always.**

Your body is not static. Your plan shouldn't be either.

</aside>

1. **What would getting in shape change most for you?**
- How I feel when I look in the mirror
- Feeling like myself again
- My energy with my kids / family
- My confidence around others
- How I feel for my partner
- My long term health
- How my clothes fit

### INFO BLOCK:

☝️ **That advice you were given? It was wrong.**

For years they said eat less fat. Count every calorie. Follow the pyramid.

Millions followed it perfectly. Millions still struggled.

The foundation was backwards. Not you.

The science has caught up. Your plan reflects that.

1. **What is your target weight?**

(Weight input)

<aside>
‼️

**☝️ HEALTH BENEFITS: Lose XX% of your weight**

Studies show that losing even 10% of your body weight can improve your health.

It may help lower the risk of heart disease, high blood sugar, and inflammation in the body.

Small changes can make a big difference.

---

**☝️ BIGGER GOAL: Lose XX% of your weight**

Research shows that people who lose more than 20% of their body weight often improve their metabolic health more than those who lose only 5–10%.

Losing more weight can lead to better energy, better blood sugar control, and better overall health.

1. **What is your age?**

<aside>

### INFO BLOCK:

☝️ **Age changes your metabolism, but it doesn’t stop results.**

As we get older, the body responds differently to food.

That’s why one-size-fits-all diets often fail after 30 or 40.

Your plan must adjust to your stage of life.
